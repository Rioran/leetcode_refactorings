# leetcode_refactorings
A project to try out some refactoring techniques inspired by Martin Fowler book.

Script for refactoring must be added to the main branch. Specific refactorings, though, must be applyed in a different branch, dedicated to this specific script.

Refactorings intent to be as small as possible. Test phase depends on leetcode itself and is out of scope for this specific project.
